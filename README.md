Site to host live WNBA Draft Lottery probabilities: https://wnba-lottery.ue.r.appspot.com/

## Purpose

While many sites are dedicated to the NBA Draft Lottery (like the great [Tankathon](http://www.tankathon.com/)), they fall short of providing live pick probabilities for each team during the lottery. When a team is revealed, this information can be used to update the probability of receiving each pick for each team. What does it mean when a team is "skipped", and how does it impact your team's probability of receiving the top pick? This tool is meant to serve these types of questions. Additionally, far fewer sites are dedicated to the WNBA Draft Lottery, so the hope is that this work enhances the enjoyment of the event!
